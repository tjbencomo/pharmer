Pyridostigmine MoA; Reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase
Atropine MoA; Non-selective muscarinic antagonist
Clonidine MoA; α2 agonist in CNS - this results in decreased sympathetic outflow

Epinephrine MoA; α1, β1, and β2-adrenergic receptor agonist
Isoproterenol MoA; Non-selective β-adrenergic receptor agonist
Methyldopa MoA; Converted to alpha-methyl-norepinephrine, which acts as a selective agonist at α2 receptors in CNS - this results in decreased sympathetic outflow
Midodrine MoA; α1-adrenergic receptor agonist
Norepinephrine MoA; α and β-adrenergic receptor agonist
Phenylephrine MoA; α1-adrenergic receptor agonist
Carvedilol MoA; α1 and β-adrenergic receptor antagonist
