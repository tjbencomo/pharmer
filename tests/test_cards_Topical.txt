Triamcinolone MoA; Binds glucocorticoid receptor to change gene expression and cell signaling leading to inhibition of leukotriene and prostaglandin synthesis.<br>Inhibition of leukocyte function, and alterations in leukocyte trafficking
Tacrolimus MoA; Binds cyclophillin and inhibits calcineurin.<br>Prevents NFAT activation and cytokine transcription
Calcipotriene MoA; Vitamin D3 analog. Inhibits proliferation and stimulates differentiation of keratinocytes
Mupirocin MoA; Inhibits isoleucyl-tRNA synthase
Clindamycin MoA; Inhibits bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit
Tretinoin MoA; Retinoic acid receptor (RAR) agonist. Corrects desquamation in acne
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) MoA; Metabolized to active FdUMP that binds and inhibits thymidylate synthetase (primary mechansm). Triphosphorylated forms incorporate into RNA and DNA to hinder nucleic acid function. Efficacy enhanced with addition of leucovorin
Aminolevulinic acid MoA; Produced ROS when exposed to blue light
Imiquimod MoA; Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR-7) agonist. Stimulates innate and adaptive immune cells

Calcipotriene adverse effects; Skin irritation, hypercalcemia
Mupirocin adverse effects; Allergic reactions, skin irritation
Clindamycin adverse effects; pseudomembranous enterocolitis
Tretinoin adverse effects; Erythema, peeling, dry skin, sun sensitivity, teratogenic
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) adverse effects; GI toxicity, myelosuppression
